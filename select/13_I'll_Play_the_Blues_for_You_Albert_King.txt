When you're down and out, and you feel real hurt
Come on over to the place where I work
An' all your loneliness, I'll try to soothe
I'll play the blues for you

Don't be afraid, come on in
You might run across, yeah, some of your old friends
All your loneliness, I'll try to soothe
I'll play the blues for you

Come on in
Sit right here, let's rap awhile
You see, I'm kinda lonely too
Loneliness is a very bad thing
And I have heard that loneliness
Blowin' some pretty good people's mind
But you can't do that
Are you comfortable
Yeah, outta sight
I said I have heard of loneliness
Blowin' some very fine people's mind
But this is a big, big world
An' there's a lot of beautiful things going in this world
You just got to hang to them and be tough

Where you live?
No, no, disregard that
The most important thing, I wanna know you
I say, yeah, I wanna know you
That's I was sayin'

I'll play the blues for you
Ain't got no big name
Oh Lord, an' I ain't no big star
But I'll play the blues for you on my guitar
And all your loneliness, I've got to soothe
I'll play the blues for you

Excuse me
